# CS-350-11041-M01-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech-2024
# Project Summary
This project aimed to develop a prototype thermostat using a TI microcontroller that supports various peripherals like I2C, GPIO, and UART. The goal was to simulate thermostat functionality including temperature sensing, LED control, and data transmission to a server via Wi-Fi.

#Achievements
I successfully implemented all required functionalities using the TI microcontroller, ensuring seamless integration of I2C for sensor communication, GPIO for LED control, and UART for data transmission. The project also effectively utilized Wi-Fi connectivity to enable cloud communication.

# Areas for Improvement
While the core functionalities were implemented well, further optimization of power consumption and memory usage could enhance the prototype's efficiency. Additionally, exploring alternative microcontroller architectures could provide insights into improving performance or reducing costs.

## Tools and Resources
In expanding my support network, I've added resources such as TI's development kits, Microchip's IoT boards, and documentation on emerging system architectures. These resources provide valuable insights and support for future projects in embedded systems and IoT.

## Transferable Skills
Skills developed in this project, such as embedded systems programming, sensor integration, and network communication protocols, are highly transferable. These skills are applicable not only to similar IoT projects but also to broader coursework in system design and architecture.

## Project Maintainability
To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I structured the code with modular design principles. Clear commenting and documentation were used throughout to explain functions and their interactions. Version control with Git facilitated collaboration and tracking changes, ensuring the project remains adaptable to future enhancements or modifications.
